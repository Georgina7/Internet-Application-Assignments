Assuming we want to consume an API, which allows us to accomplish the
following:
- Order food from a restaurant (sitting in a totally different web app) by entering the food
item and number of units you want. The API will respond back with order ID and total cost of
your order.
- Check the status of the order from another system by entering the order ID.

You are required to create a simple interface, which allows a user to accomplish the two tasks. Now
that the API is not working yet, just collect the information you need and inform the user that this
feature is coming soon.
